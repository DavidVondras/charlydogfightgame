A 2d dogfight game coded in c++ with sfml and box2d (the dependencies are in the solution folder).

The solution is currently configured for visual studio 2010 and is not compatible with other IDEs, but I am very concerned in the portability of this game.
Some re work will be done later for this.

It is currently under development, no binary is available.
